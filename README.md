# rankMyHospital

## üí°Introduction

This R project analyzes hospital performance across the U.S.

based on 30-day mortality rates for serious conditions.

It includes 3 main functions:

- `best()`: Best hospital in a given state for an outcome
- `rankhospital()`: Hospital of a given rank in a state for an outcome
- `rankall()`: Hospital of rank num in every state for an outcome

## ü©∫ Supported Outcomes

- ‚Äúheart attack‚Äù
- ‚Äúheart failure‚Äù
- ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù

## üìä Functions

### `best(state, outcome)`

Returns the hospital with the lowest 30-day mortality rate

in the given state for a specific outcome.

```r
 best("TX", "heart attack")
[1] "CYPRESS FAIRBANKS MEDICAL CENTER"
```

### `rankhospital(state, outcome, num = "best")`

Returns the hospital of the given rank (e.g. "best", "worst", or a specific numeric rank) for the selected state and outcome.

```r
rankhospital("TX", "heart failure", 4)
[1] "DETAR HOSPITAL NAVARRO"
```

### `rankall(outcome, num = "best")`

Returns a data frame with the hospital of the given rank for each state.

```r
tail(rankall("pneumonia", "worst"), 3)
                                     hospital state
WI MAYO CLINIC HEALTH SYSTEM - NORTHLAND, INC    WI
WV                     PLATEAU MEDICAL CENTER    WV
WY           NORTH BIG HORN HOSPITAL DISTRICT    WY
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site run by the [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/).

[Download dataset (zip)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2FProgAssignment3-data.zip)

The zip file for this assignment contains three files
‚Ä¢ *outcome-of-care-measures.csv*: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates
for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.
‚Ä¢ *hospital-data.csv*: Contains information about each hospital.
‚Ä¢ *Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf*: Descriptions of the variables in each file (i.e the code book).

## üóíÔ∏èFinal Notes

This project was developed as part of an R programming course

focused on data manipulation, functional programming, and

real-world healthcare data analysis. The goal was to explore

hospital ranking techniques using actual datasets while applying

robust input validation, custom sorting logic, and practical

data wrangling skills in R.
